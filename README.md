# ObjectListView

> ObjectListView is a C# wrapper around a .NET ListView. It makes the ListView much easier to use and teaches it some neat new tricks.

ObjectListView is a C# convenience wrapper around .NET's ListView. It makes the ListView much easier to use by supporting automatic sorting, grouping, cell editing, data binding, reporting, column sizing. There is also a Python version for wxPython.

### Features

- Columns can be fixed-width, have a minimum and/or maximum width, or be space-filling

- Displays a “list is empty” message when the list is empty (obviously)

- Supports Excel-like column filtering

- The `FastObjectListView` version can build a list of 10,000 objects in less than 0.1

[Phillip Piper](https://sourceforge.net/u/grammarian/profile/) created an awesome C# wrapper around a .NET `ListView`. He calls his `ObjectListView` a *".NET ListView on caffeine, guarana and steroids."*

*This fork* implements updates and minor enhancements.

The original project is available at [SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/objectlistview/) with a [discussion forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/objectlistview/discussion/) being still active.
